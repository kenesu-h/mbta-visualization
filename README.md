# mbta-visualization

A project for an English class (yes, English) meant to explore multimodality, instead turned into an
entire data visualization project for the MBTA. This project aims to explore how late trains are at
individual stations across the MBTA, given that:
- The MBTA is notorious for accidents and slow trains.
- This data isn't very accessible otherwise.

This data is retrieved using the MBTA's [V3 API](https://api-v3.mbta.com/) and
[Performance API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/mbta-performance). As of writing this, neither API
requires keys, but this may change in the future.

You're free to do whatever you want with this repo as long as it abides by the license, but just
don't expect beautiful code.
